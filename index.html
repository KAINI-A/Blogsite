            <h3> Journey to the Heart of the Himalayas: 
            </h3>
            

            <p> Located amidst the majestic Himalayas, the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek is an expedition that offers a comprehensive package of adventure and natural grandeur. In the beginning, I had been under the idea that hiking in the Himalayas was a superhuman feat which only people who would climb mountains could do. But my experience on the ABC trek changed all of this for me and uncovered a trail that was doable, rewarding and extremely impactful.The Annapurna Base Camp trek is also known as the Annapurna Sanctuary trek which is a moderate to challenging trek passing through different landscapes of a lush rhododendron forest, terraced field & alpine meadows to glacial moraines. This trek ends up at an elevation of 4,130 meters Base Camp, viewed below peak hallmarks such as Annapurna I, Machapuchare and Hiunchuli.</p>

<p>The Annapurna Base Camp trek is a rewarding adventure I highly recommend to others for its stunning landscapes, unique cultural experiences, and the sense of accomplishment it offers. Whether you're seeking breathtaking mountain views, immersion in local traditions, or a manageable physical challenge, this trek provides an unforgettable journey for all who undertake it.</p>

<p>I honestly thought that an Annapurna Base Camp trek was going to be extremely hard and that only experienced trekkers were able to do it. These preconceptions were mainly due to the scary pictures from the Himalayas and tales of absurd conditions told by Panifex Mountaineers. I was nervous about how I would physically hold up and also the potential dangers were frightening as well. Here I was, a young man 16 years old and this place seemed like it was halfway around the world; could I really get there? And all along with the wrong gears and nothing past prior experience — I knew it was gonna be a hell of a ride!</p>

<p>The journey began with the three of us: my brother, my uncle, and me. Initially, my brother and I made this plan, but our parents thought it was too dangerous for us to go alone and denied us any money. We convinced our uncle, a retired army colonel, to accompany us, and finally, our parents agreed. Our journey started at 7:00 AM when we left for Pokhara. We had a flight at 8:00 AM and barely made it to the airport. Not a great start, right? After reaching Pokhara, we had dinner and then left for Nayapul. After a long three-hour bus ride, we finally arrived. I looked around and thought to myself, “Where am I?” Living in the city had made rural areas feel very unfamiliar to me. We stayed there for the night, and the next day, our main journey began—on foot.</p>

<p>Our trek began after it was dawn. It was the majestic waterfalls, the lush jungle, and the snow-capped mountains. I knew we had more to see. At last we reached Ghandruk and took some rest. There was the sense of Gurung communities and their traditions — really beautiful — with a great taste in food. The first day of any trek, climbing can be difficult because the body must acclimatize gradually to higher altitudes and lower oxygen levels. Already tired legs couldn´t stop when I was so excited. We forded rivers over narrow bridges of logs and boulders. Among other examples, you may fear the danger thinking how scary one of those raft rides would be upon crossing a fast river walking on some piece of log. Finally, we arrived at our place for the day – Chhomrong. Chhomrong's welcome board declared it a "Mineral Water Ban Area" featuring their own handiwork in promoting use of "Safe Drinking Water", as part of ACAP restaurants throughout the trail that provided us bottles refill. For the villages on the trail, basic aura is available in small local markets; many may find woolen clothes weaved and tailored locally and other trekking gears. The aroma of fresh-baked cakes and bread from the bakeries of Chhomrong wafted down over the terraced fields through this town at such a height. The mountains were staring at my face as I had never seen them so close. My legs were swelling, and I started to remember my home where I could go to my mom for a massage.</p>

<p>At 4 AM, we were on our way to our next destination. I was dumbfounded when my uncle told me that we were going to reach Machapuchare Base Camp today. People usually reach there on their fourth day of the trek, and we were going to go there on the second day. I stared at my brother, and he was staring back at me with smiles on his face, lol. During the day, we were mostly walking through the hills. We sometimes stopped near the waterfall to freshen up and fill our water bottles. The cold waters straight from the Himalayas used to chill my spine. I wonder when I am going to get to drink those icy freshwaters again. We passed through many small villages on our way. Their way of doing things was very different to me. The stone-clay houses, the noise of rice grinding in stone, and the smell of cow dung had a different vibe in itself. Just before we reached Upper Deurali, a whole herd of sheep came our way. They were in the hundreds. I had never seen so many sheep in my life. We waited for 10 minutes for all the sheep to pass by and had our first lunch at Upper Deurali. Upper Deurali was at a height of 3200m, and when we started trekking again, I started to see snow on the roads. It was my first time seeing snow as it never snowed where I lived. We took some photos as well. It was getting dark, and the road from Deurali was getting tougher. We sometimes had to climb very steep walls as well. Now when I think of it, it was kinda fun. It had started to get darker, and the clouds were waiting to pour rain out of them. We finally reached Machapuchare Base Camp at 6 PM. Machapuchare mountain is considered to be the holy abode of Lord Shiva. After having our dinner, I went outside. It was freezing cold as we were at the height of 3700m. I turned back to see the mountains, and I was in awe. The sky and the mighty mountains blended as if they were one! I had never seen such beautiful mountains at night. I clicked some photos and went to sleep. I couldn’t get proper sleep that night due to two reasons. One, I was freezing cold, and two, ABC was our next stop early in the morning.</p>

<p>The next morning, we packed our bags, put on more clothes, and at 4 AM, we were off to ABC. The grandeur of the other mountains (Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Gangapurna, and Hiunchuli) had been captivating us from Machapuchare Base Camp. We started getting closer to them as we progressed towards Annapurna Base Camp from MBC, while the peaks kept playing hide and seek in the clouds. By the time we made it to the Annapurna Base Camp, the mountain peaks had started fading away in the low light, but the vibrant prayer flags that welcomed us at the base camp lifted us up after a long day. I thought we were unlucky as we didn’t get to see all of it, but I guess God had some other plans. When the sun rays created a magical glitter on the Himalayan peaks in the morning, I was left spellbound with the stunning 360-degree panoramic view of the 10th highest mountain on earth - Annapurna I (8091m), Annapurna III (7555m), Annapurna South (7219m), Gangapurna (7455m), Machapuchare (6993m), Baraha Shikhar / Annapurna Fang (7647m), Hiunchuli (6441m), and Singu Chuli (Fluted Peak).</p>

<p>Being face to face with these majestic Himalayas felt divine, and it was extremely difficult for me to say goodbye to them. Going back is the hardest part of the trek as the mountains invariably build an emotional connection with everyone. Thanking the heavens for rewarding us with such an intimate time with the Himalayan beauties, we started descending through the same route and stopped at Chhomrong for the night. Yes, Chhomrong! We went from 4130m to 2170m in a day. All thanks to the army spirit. On the way back, I didn’t have much of a hard time as my legs were only going downhill. We had our dinner at Chhomrong and stayed there for the night. The next morning, we headed for Pokhara to catch our flight, and as always, it was half an hour. Thankfully, the flight got delayed, and we were able to hop in at the last minute.</p>

<p>The physical challenge of the trek is also a significant draw. While the trek is demanding, it is accessible to individuals with moderate fitness levels. The struggle to acclimatize to higher altitudes and lower oxygen levels is real, but the sense of accomplishment upon reaching each milestone is incredibly rewarding. The trek also offers moments of fun and excitement, such as crossing rivers on log bridges and encountering herds of sheep.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Annapurna Base Camp trek is considered a moderate trek compared to other high-altitude treks in Nepal. It is shorter, lower, and easier than the Everest Base Camp trek, making it an ideal choice for those who are reasonably fit and determined (Amgai). The well-established trail and the availability of good trekking lodges along the route add to the convenience and safety of the trek (Thapaliya).</p>

<p>Safety is another important aspect to consider. The Annapurna Base Camp trek is generally safe if certain precautions are taken. The main risk is avalanches, but this can be mitigated by following the advice of local guides and avoiding the risky zones during the avalanche season (Thapaliya). The best time to trek is during the pre-monsoon (February to May) and post-monsoon (September to December) seasons when the weather is dry and stable. During these times, the skies are clear, and the views of the mountains are at their best (Kansakar).</p>

<p>The Annapurna Base Camp trek is a transformative journey that offers a perfect blend of adventure, natural beauty, and cultural immersion. It is an experience that will leave you with lasting memories and a deep appreciation for the majestic Himalayas. Whether you are an experienced trekker or a novice, the ABC trek promises an unforgettable adventure that is both rewarding and enriching. The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot, so get out there and travel as much as you can, as the mountains are the beginning and the end of all natural scenery.</p>
<h4>Reflecting on the Bond and Lessons Learned </h4>

<p>The death of my grandfather was a profound and life-altering event that left an indelible mark on my heart and soul. He was not just a family member but a mentor, a friend, and a guiding light in my life. Growing up, I spent countless hours listening to his stories, absorbing his wisdom, and learning from his experiences. His passing left a void that felt impossible to fill, and the grief was overwhelming. However, through this difficult time, I discovered an inner strength I didn’t know I had, and I learned valuable lessons about resilience, love, and the importance of family.</p>

<p>My grandfather was a man of great wisdom and compassion. He had lived through many hardships and triumphs, and his life was a testament to the power of perseverance and kindness. He often shared stories of his youth, tales of struggle and success that were both inspiring and humbling. These stories were more than just anecdotes; they were lessons in resilience and determination. He taught me the importance of hard work, the value of honesty, and the significance of treating others with respect and kindness.</p>

<p>My grandfather, Danda Pani Kaini (DAN-DA-PA-NI KAI-NEY), was born and raised in Tanahun. He lived to the age of 81, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire me. He served as the mayor of our district for three consecutive terms, a testament to his leadership and the deep respect he commanded. Known for his calm demeanor and honest opinions, he was always ready to help anyone who came to his door. My father often told me that my grandfather was so beloved by the villagers that he never needed to campaign for elections; he always won by a landslide. He had two sons and five daughters, with my father being the oldest son but younger than all his sisters. Whenever I see my father, I am reminded of my grandfather. My father’s face brings back vivid memories of my grandpa, and I often see a reflection of him in my father’s actions and words. People frequently tell me that I share many of my grandfather’s traits, and it fills me with pride and happiness to hear that.
</p>

<p>My family moved to the capital when I was 2 years old. My grandparents insisted on staying in their home, believing that city life was not for them. They lived by themselves, and we would visit them twice a year during festivals and winter. Initially, I thought spending such a long break at their place would be boring, as we would stay for at least a month. However, as our holidays drew to a close, I always felt a sense of gloom because I didn’t want to leave. My siblings and I would often argue over who would get to sleep with Grandpa. Despite being young, our grandparents’ house never felt like we had left home; it felt like our true home.</p>

<p>I had my own personal connections with my grandpa as well. I clearly remember all the things I did with him. One of the most essential skills I pride myself on is farming, which he taught me. From digging up the land to understanding the types of fertilizers and pesticides used, he taught me everything. I used to tag along with him when he went down to the rice fields. While he worked, I played in the muddy fields, watching and learning. I also helped him with small tasks like planting seeds and watering the fields.</p>

<p>During the festive seasons, I would accompany him to the nearby market to buy essentials. These trips were special because he would treat me to different foods. These experiences not only taught me practical skills but also strengthened our bond. They are memories I cherish deeply, and they remind me of the invaluable lessons and love my grandpa shared with me.</p>

<p>My grandparents were always thrilled to see us when we visited. They would welcome us with handpicked fruits, their faces lighting up with joy. When the holidays were ending, my grandparents always asked me to stay a bit longer. I would look up to my dad, and he would reassure them that I would be back soon, but for now, I couldn’t stay any longer. When it was time to say goodbye, they would secretly give me some money and tell me to buy something to eat on the way home. These small gestures made me feel loved and cherished, and they are memories I hold dear to this day.</p>

<p>My grandfather’s health began to deteriorate when he was in his mid-70s. He had been an active smoker until his 50s, which eventually led to lung issues. Although he quit smoking after learning about his health condition, he had already developed asthma by then. My grandfather’s health began to deteriorate when he was in his 70s. Since then, he frequently had to come to the capital to get his health checked. While he was with us, he always told me that he missed the village soil. He was never fond of the city population. The busy city and the individuality in the city never made him feel at home. He used to stay with us for a month and then return to his place. He always had a lot of prescriptions for his medicine, which became a daily essential in his life. As his health became more serious, we had to bring him to live with us after a few years. Despite his condition, he still tried to be energetic while he was with us. In the following years, he faced some major difficulties but always bounced back. Slowly, he couldn’t walk on his own. I used to take him to the roof, and we would stay in the sun and talk about the political issues happening in our country. He still knew everything and spent most of his time watching TV.</p>

<p>I saw him happy after a long time when we performed a ritual for him that he had always wanted. It was called CHAU-RA-SHI and was held after a person crossed 80 years. However, he slowly became bedridden and needed help with everything. It was just a matter of time, and he knew it as well. My grandpa passed away in the morning. I still remember my mom rushing down, panicked. There were sounds of cries everywhere. My father and my uncle had their eyes filled with tears, but they stood strong and looked after everyone else. I couldn’t process what was happening as tears streamed down my cheeks. I started recalling all the moments with him. After a couple of hours, we began our rituals and took him to PASHUPATINATH, a temple considered one of the most sacred abodes of God Shiva.</p>

<p>My grandfather passed away a year ago. Initially, I was in denial, unable to accept the reality of his death. As reality set in, I experienced a wave of emotions – anger, sadness, and even guilt for not spending more time with him. It was a rollercoaster of feelings that left me emotionally drained. </p>

<p>Despite the pain and sadness, my grandfather’s death also brought my family closer together. We found comfort in each other, sharing stories and memories that kept his spirit alive. We laughed and cried together, and in those moments of shared grief, we found strength and unity. His passing reminded us of the importance of family, and it reinforced the bonds that held us together. We supported each other through the difficult times, and this collective strength helped us navigate the emotional journey of loss.</p>

<p>However, as time passed, I began to find peace in the memories we shared. I realized that while he was no longer physically present, his spirit and the impact he had on my life would always remain. I started to focus on celebrating his life rather than mourning his death. This shift in perspective helped me heal and find a sense of closure. One of the most significant changes I experienced was in my perspective on life. My grandfather’s death was a painful reminder of the impermanence of life, but it also inspired me to live more fully. I realized that life is too short to hold onto grudges, to be consumed by stress, or to be afraid of taking risks. I became more open to new experiences, more willing to step out of my comfort zone, and more appreciative of the beauty in everyday moments. His passing taught me to embrace life with all its uncertainties and to find joy in the journey. My grandfather's legacy lives on in the values he instilled in me, and his memory continues to guide me in my journey through life.</p>

            <h2>POEMS:</h2>
            <h3> Her eyes </h3>

            <p>The sparkle in your eyes, it does play a game,
Played so well, it even puts a glistening diamond to shame. <br>
The spark isn’t always there to be seen though,<br>
At times, it gets hidden behind a dark worrisome cloud.<br>
Your eyes sometimes tell a story, other times a tale,<br>
They can keep a sailor in Love afloat, even on the most turbulent sails.</p>

<p>There’s a meaning in your eyes and other times a purpose,<br>
If purpose makes a home permanently, nothing for you is impossible, I suppose.<br>
Your eyes when looking into mine can make me feel,<br>
The deepest of emotions and they also carry that power to heal.</p>

<p>My mind cannot fathom a color to describe the color of your eyes,<br>
Sometimes they shine with love, sometimes care, sometimes anger, and sometimes peaceful whites.<br>
When your eyes have a cold brazen look,<br>
I feel sad and want to hide and I try to find a corner or a nook.</p>

<p>When your eyes sometimes get moist with tears,<br>
All I can think of is how to allay your fears.<br>
When your eyes are afraid of someone or something,<br>
I would do whatever it takes to get rid of that feeling.<br>
At times silence feels blissful when looking into your eyes,<br>
Those Unspoken words conveyed when our eyes meet, do feel nice.</p>

<p>For she had such beautiful eyes and chose me<br>
Like stars that guide the lost at sea.<br>
In her gaze, I found my way,<br>
Where love and light forever stay.</p>

            <h2>WRITINGS:</h2>

            <h3> What makes me happy? </h3>
            <p>Happiness is weird, isn’t it? One day, it feels like it’s everywhere, and the next, you’re wondering if it took a vacation without telling you. Today, though, I want to share a few things that never fail to make me happy.<p>

<p>I’m happy when it’s not freezing in the morning. On those rare days, I can actually drag myself out of bed and get ready for my 8 a.m. class without feeling like I’m fighting a war with my blanket.
Happiness also rings through my phone when I’m completely drained after a hectic day. I see my mom’s name flash on the caller ID, and suddenly, everything feels a little brighter. Her voice has a way of grounding me, even when the day feels like it’s falling apart.</p>

<p>I feel a spark of joy while strolling down the streets and spotting a dog. I stop to pat them, and for a moment, I’m reminded of my own dog back home. It’s like a little piece of home finds me wherever I am.
Another simple joy? Not having to cook dinner. When it’s not my turn, I can raminto the kitchen, grab a plate of food, and just eat—no chopping, no cooking, no tears over onions.</p>

<p>And then there’s the satisfaction of exchanging ideas with my professors in class. I love being engaged, contributing my thoughts, and knowing that I’m part of a larger conversation.</p>

<p>But, as much as these moments make me happy, they don’t always happen.</p>

<p>The days are getting colder now, and soon, it’ll be so chilly that even the thought of getting out of bed feels like a Herculean task. I’ve already missed two classes because of this, and who knows how many more I’ll skip before the season ends.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on my roughest days, my mom doesn’t call. She might be sleeping on the other side of the world, and I’m left wishing for her comfort while my day drags on.</p>


<p>On some walks, there are no dogs. The streets feel a little emptier, and so do I.</p>

<p>And then, there are those nights when it is my turn to cook dinner. The dreaded chopping begins, and don’t even get me started on onions—they bring tears to my eyes. Even in class, there are days when my focus shifts. I sit there, disconnected, not contributing a word, let alone having a meaningful chat with the professor.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: these ups and downs? They’re part of life. The cold mornings, the missed calls, the onion-induced tears, and even the classes I skip—they’re not going away. And you know what? I’m okay with that.If everything went perfectly all the time, wouldn’t life just get boring? Would I really feel happy if I had nothing to compare it to? Probably not.</p>

<p>So, I’ve learned to embrace it all—the good, the bad, and the utterly ridiculous. Because, in the end, those small bursts of happiness wouldn’t feel so special if they happened every single day.
</p>

<h4> Your Past Trauma Isn’t an Excuse—It’s a Starting Point </h4>
<p> Let’s face it: life is tough, and we’ve all been hurt in some way. Trauma is real, and the pain it causes is valid. But here’s a truth I’ve learned the hard way: your past trauma isn’t a reason to stay stuck—it’s a starting point for who you can become.</p>

<p>Let me share a personal story that helped me understand this truth firsthand. When I was in school, I was one of the shortest kids in my class, barely 5’2”. My height made me an easy target for bullies, and no one bullied harder than Sandeep. He wasn’t just a bully; he led a group that thrived on intimidation. He’d steal lunches, take money, and make threats. I hoped he’d eventually stop, but he didn’t. Instead, I felt smaller and more powerless with each passing day.</p>

<p>For a long time, I avoided conflict. I stayed quiet, invisible, and distant, hoping the bullying would end. But deep down, I was tired. Tired of being pushed around. Tired of being overlooked. One day, while playing football, Sandeep confronted me again. He was loud, cocky, and relentless. And in that moment, something inside me snapped. I decided I wouldn’t back down anymore. I stood up to him, and the next thing I knew, I had hit him hard. Sandeep fell, bloodied and stunned, and the entire field went silent.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying violence is the solution to every problem. But in that moment, it was about standing up for myself when no one else would. It wasn’t a moment I’m necessarily proud of, but it was a turning point. I discovered a strength within me I didn’t know I had. The fear that had weighed me down for so long disappeared. When we were called to the principal’s office, I stood my ground and said, “You knew who Sandeep was and what he did, but you didn’t stop him. I did your job for you.” After some discussion, I was let off. Walking out of that room, I felt something I hadn’t in a long time: and that was pride.</p>

<p>From that day forward, my life changed. People no longer saw me as the small, timid kid. I wasn’t just standing taller physically; I was standing taller mentally and emotionally. I began to enjoy life again, building friendships and discovering confidence I didn’t know I had.</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize that moment wasn’t just about confronting a bully. It was about confronting my own fear and reclaiming my sense of worth. It taught me a powerful lesson: trauma doesn’t have to define you—it can transform you. The pain I went through became the fuel I needed to grow stronger. As Robert Jordan once said, “The oak fought the wind and was broken, the willow bent when it must and survived.” Resilience often comes from adapting and finding strength in our lowest moments.</p>

<p>Even now, that lesson sticks with me. Whenever I face challenges, I remind myself of that day. Life isn’t fair, but you can choose how to respond. You can stay stuck in your past, or you can use it as a foundation for the incredible person you’re meant to become. This moment taught me that reclaiming your power begins with confronting your fears. It’s not about the size of the obstacle but your willingness to face it.</p>

<p>Have you ever faced a moment where you had to decide between staying silent or standing up for yourself? What did you do? Or what could you have done to change the story? The truth is, we all have that inner strength—it’s just waiting for us to claim it.</p>

<p>Your past doesn’t define you—it’s the foundation for your strength. No matter what you’ve been through, the future is unwritten and yours to shape. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it guide you toward becoming the person you’re meant to be.</p>

<h3> A Tree, A Smile, A Prayer </h3>
            <p>On a chilly December night, I was returning home from my usual evening stroll when a stunningly beautiful Christmas tree caught my eye. It stood tall, glowing warmly against the dark sky, its ornaments sparkling with charm. The sight was so captivating that I couldn’t resist stopping to take a few portraits. As I admired the tree, I noticed a man nearby, also taking photos of it. He turned to me with a warm smile and said, “Hi, how are you doing?” </p>

<p>That simple greeting reminded me of one of the things I love most about this town—the people. There’s a unique warmth here, a kindness that feels genuine. Strangers exchange smiles and greetings, making even the coldest night feel a little warmer. I smiled back and replied, “Hello. The tree looks absolutely amazing, doesn’t it?” His face brightened instantly, and with a wide grin, he said, “Really? Thank you so much!” For a moment, I was puzzled—until I noticed the subtle pride in his expression and realized he was the one who had decorated the tree.</p>

<p>We exchanged a few more pleasantries before heading our separate ways, but as I walked away, a thought lingered in my mind. We, as humans, are such innocent creatures at our core. Beneath the layers of ambition, greed, and the endless chase for more, there’s a purity in us that seeks only joy, connection, and meaning. If we could let go of the selfish desires that so often cloud our hearts and instead focus on the simple things that bring us true happiness, the world would be so much more beautiful. The vibrancy and warmth we could share with one another would be unmatched—a reflection of the beauty in that tree.</p>

<p>As these thoughts swirled in my mind, I found myself silently praying. “Oh God,” I whispered, “please leave a little bit of the child in all of us, even as we grow older. Let us hold on to that pure, carefree spirit we had when we were young. Those were the moments when we truly knew how to find joy in the simplest things.”</p>
